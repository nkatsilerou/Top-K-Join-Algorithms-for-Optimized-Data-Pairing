Implemented two algorithms for top-K join operations to identify pairs of entries with the highest summed weights based on shared attributes, using census data. The first approach employed a hash-based priority queue with a threshold update mechanism, while the second used a hash table for pre-filtering valid entries. Both implementations were benchmarked for execution time across varying K values, highlighting trade-offs in efficiency and complexity.
